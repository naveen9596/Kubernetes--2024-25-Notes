If error message indicates that using the `docker` driver with root privileges is not recommended. Instead, you can use the `none` driver if you must run Minikube as root. Here are the steps to proceed:

1. **Use the `none` driver**:
   ```sh
   minikube start --driver=none
   ```

2. **Run Minikube as a non-root user**:
   If possible, create a non-root user and run Minikube from that user. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

   ```sh
   adduser minikubeuser
   usermod -aG docker minikubeuser
   su - minikubeuser
   minikube start --driver=docker
   ```

3. **Force Minikube to use the `docker` driver with root privileges**:
   If you still want to proceed with the `docker` driver as root (not recommended), you can use the `--force` flag:

   ```sh
   minikube start --driver=docker --force
   ```

Running Minikube as a non-root user is generally the best practice for security reasons. If you choose to use the `none` driver, ensure that your system meets the requirements and that Docker is properly installed and configured.
