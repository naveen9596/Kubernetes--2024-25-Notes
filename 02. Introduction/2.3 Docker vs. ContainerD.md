## Differences between Docker and ContainerD

So you’re going to come across Docker and containerd many times. Going forward, when you read older blogs or
documentation pages , you’ll see Docker mentioned along with Kubernetes and when you read newer blogs you’ll see 
containerd and you’ll wonder what the difference is between the two. And there are a few CLI tools like ctr, crictl or
nerdctl and you’ll wonder what are these CLI tools and which one should you be using, so that’s what I’m going to explain.

Let’s go back in time to the beginning of the container era. In the beginning, there was just Docker. There were a few other tools like Rocket (rkt), but Docker’s user experience made working with containers super simple and hence Docker became the most dominant container tool. And then came Kubernetes to orchestrate Docker so Kubernetes was built to orchestrate Docker specifically in the beginning so Docker and Kubernetes were tightly coupled and back then Kubernetes only worked with Docker and didn't support any other container solutions.

And then Kubernetes grew in popularity as a container orchestrator and now other container runtimes like rkt wanted in so Kubernetes users needed it to work with container runtimes that are other than just Docker, and so Kubernetes introduced an interface called container runtime interface or CRI, so CRI allowed any vendor to work as a container runtime for Kubernetes as long as they adhere to the OCI standards. So OCI stands for Open Container Initiative and it consists of an image spec and a runtime spec. Image spec means the specifications on how an image should be built. It defines the specifications on how an image should be built and the runtime spec defines the standards on how any container runtime should be developed so keeping these standards in mind, anyone can build a container runtime that can be used by anybody to work with Kubernetes, so that was the idea.
